## Repo introduction

*MEAN* is a front-end project completed with above technologies and *the last station of my [winter vacation](https://github.com/Gusabary/Winter-Vacation)*. [Back-end](http://meandemo-env.2ammmpcvep.ap-southeast-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/) deployed, you can behave just like in a simple blog or forum such as: register an account, log in, publish, edit or delete your own articles and view ones written by others.

### Run locally

1. Make sure you have installed [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/zh-cn/), which are essential to this project running locally.
2. `git clone` this repo and use `yarn install` to install all dependencies in `package.json`. 
3. Use `yarn start` to run the project.

If you want to know more about commands of `npm` and `yarn`, [this doc](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md) may help.

Some websites and learning notes in [this repo](https://github.com/Gusabary/Winter-Vacation) can help, too.

### Something trivial

The repo name *MEAN* means a full stack project that uses *mongoDB* as database, *Express* as back-end frame, *Angular* as front-end frame and *Node.js* as environment. At first, I don't know that. Instead I think *MEAN* is just the name of the project. But when I was told the special meaning, I  had got used to the name although my front-end frame is *React* and I don't even use the first two tools (*M* and *E*). 

Coincidently, the assignment itself was really *mean*: Only when great great efforts have been made can you get a sense of achievement.

But generally, I had a lot of harvest through the project and here I want to thank a great TA---[lxyl](https://github.com/linxuyalun) !!
